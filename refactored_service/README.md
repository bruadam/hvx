# HVX CODEX Brick-Enabled Skeleton

This package is a scaffold for a folder-based, Brick-compatible analytics system.
It includes:

- Folder-based standards (EN16798-1, TAIL, BR18)
- Folder-based ingestion connectors (Eloverblik, CSV)
- Folder-based simulation models (EEMeter, RC model)
- Folder-based analytics modules
- Core Pydantic models
- Brick importer/exporter with mapping YAMLs
- Neo4j schema seeds

This is **not** a complete product, but a starting point to integrate into HVX.
